Welcome to my implementation of neural nets!

Format:
 -A neural network will be represented as an array of Layer objects, as well as an error function
 -A Layer object will feature:
    -Weights between this layer and the previous as a numpy array (layer.W)
    -Activation function for this layer (of type ActivationFun)
